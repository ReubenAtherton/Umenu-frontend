# Umenu 
Welcome to Umenu! An app that lets users view professionally taken, up to date images of a restaurant's entire menu.  

The app would be free for users whilst restaurants pay a monthly fee to be shown on the app (essentially an advertising platform for them). Our team would take professional images of each dish giving users an idea of what they are ordering (often the images submitted by google users are not very good).

I designed and built this app to test this idea for a startup company. The backend uses Python's FastAPI to handle requests. I have not made the backend code for this app public.
